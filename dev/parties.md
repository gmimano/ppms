***Governance of political parties in Kenya***
The governance structure of political parties in Kenya is established by the **Constitution of Kenya, 2010** and the **Political Parties Act, 2011**, which mandates a **democratically elected governing body** and a functional organizational structure at both national and county levels. The Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) is the independent state office responsible for the regulation and oversight of these parties. 

***Key Features of Governance***

-   **Legal Basis:** Parties are legal entities that can sue, be sued, and own property. Their operations are governed by their own constitutions, which must align with national laws.
-   **Democratic Elections:** Parties must promote and practice democracy through regular, fair, and free internal elections to select their governing body members and candidates for public office.
-   **Inclusivity and Diversity:** The composition of all party organs must reflect regional and ethnic diversity, representation of minorities and marginalized groups, and adhere to the principle that not more than two-thirds of the members are of the same gender.
-   **National Character:** To be fully registered, a party must have at least 1,000 registered members from more than half of Kenya's counties, demonstrating a national reach. 

Organizational Structure
Each political party is required to have a clear management structure, including roles and responsibilities, at the following levels: 

-   **National Level:** Each party must have a head office and a democratically elected governing body.
-   **County Level:** Parties must maintain functional branch offices in at least 24 counties to serve as a link with grassroots members and the headquarters. 

Oversight and Dispute Resolution

-   **Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP):** This independent state office regulates, monitors, and investigates political parties to ensure compliance with the law. It administers the Political Parties Fund and verifies party membership lists.
-   **Internal Dispute Resolution Mechanism (IDRM):** Parties must establish an independent internal system to resolve disputes among members expeditiously and in writing. All internal remedies must be exhausted before appealing to the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal.
-   **Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT):** This independent tribunal is established by the Political Parties Act, 2011, to determine disputes between party members, between political parties, and appeals from decisions of the Registrar. 

Accountability and Transparency
Parties are required to maintain accurate and authentic records, including a register of members, audited financial accounts, policy documents, and details of their officials and assets. These records are subject to inspection by the Registrar and party members upon request.

***Financial Administration***
Political parties require financial resources to sustain and operate a basic party structure. Section 23 of the Act establishes the Political Parties Fund (PPF).  The PPF administered by the Registrar with the reason to ensure that funds are used prudently. The sources of funds for a political party are:

-   The Political Parties Fund (PPF);
-   Membership fees;
-   Voluntary contributions from a lawful source;
-   Donations, bequests and grants from any other lawful source, not being from a non-citizen, foreign government, inter-governmental or non-governmental organization; and
-   The proceeds of any investment, project or undertaking in which the political party has an interest.

***Party Management***
A party must have an organizational structure at national and county level with all relevant and elected party bodies and organs. The governing body must reflect regional and ethnic diversity and representation of minorities and marginalized groups. Not more than two-third of the members of the governing body are of the same gender. The party must demonstrate that members of the governing body meet the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution and the laws relating to ethics.

It is therefore a requirement that every political party in Kenya must have a:

-   National character.
-   Have democratically elected governing body.
-   Promote and uphold national unity.
-   Abide by the democratic principles of good governance, promote and practice democracy through regular, fair and free elections within the party.

-   Respect and promote gender equality and equity.

The party must have a clear management structure including roles and responsibilities and the procedures to be followed. To address potential conflicts in the party, it must have permanent dispute and conflict resolution mechanism.

Among the documents required for a political party are:

-   Party constitution.
-   Nomination rules and procedures.
-   Internal party election rules and procedures.
-   Party policy document(s).
-   Party policy reporting document.

***Political Party Records***
Political party documents are fundamental for party institutionalizing, inclusive participation, education of party members and the public at large, accountability and transparency and responsible representation.

The Office of the Registrar of Political Parties may request copies of documents to be furnished upon request. Any person who interferes, damages or destroys any record or fails to furnish any document required commits an offence.
